1.  stdint.h is a C standard library header file declares sets of integer type with specific bits size.
2.  Makes it clear to count the size of various types of data.
3.  BYTE:1byte, DWORD:4bytes, LONG:4bytes, WORD:2bytes
4.  ASCII:BM, decimal:19778, hexadecimal:0x42 0x4D
5.  bfSize is BMP file size includes size of image and header, biSize is BMP image size includes size of RGBTRIPLE and padding.
6.  It means the image is top-down.
7.  biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth.
8.  It might because the file doesn't exist or don't have permission or other error.
9.  Because we only read one block at a time.
10. If bi.biWidth is 3, padding = (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4, the value of padding is 3.
11. Change the location of the file pointer.
12. The referent location for the fseek function, cur means current location of the file pointer.
